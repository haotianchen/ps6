## Introduction to Data Analysis
This class heavily relies on the interactive online textbook, CourseKata. To successfully run any code you learn in class, you need to load the `coursekata` package first. Remember to run this line of code at the top of any script you write in this class.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(coursekata)
```

Otherwise, you will get an error message that says `could not find function...`.
