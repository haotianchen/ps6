## TA Section Syllabus
**Meeting Time and Location**: We will meet every Friday online. Please use this Zoom [link](https://ucla.zoom.us/j/92902161338). You have to attend the full 50-minute session to receive full credits. Please display your full name. 

**Format**: During each section, we will quickly review the lecture materials in the first 10 minutes. We will then discuss any questions you may have about the Jupyter Notebook assignments, CK Chapters, or upcoming quizzes for the rest of the time. 

**Section Policy**: To receive credits for the Zoom section, you need to:
+ Attend the full 50 minutes (do not be late or leave early).
+ Display your full name.
+ Open your camera.
+ Answer pop quiz questions.   

**Communication**: My email address is: barneychen@ucla.edu. I will reply to your email within 24 to 48 hours (except weekends or holidays). Please adhere to professional email etiquette. 

**Office Hours**: My office hours are by appointment, using this [link](https://calendly.com/barneych/ps6) to sign up. I usually hold them on Fridays, from 3 to 5 pm. 

**Grade Policy**: For grading policy, please refer to the course website. Your grade is calculated based on four parts: 
+ "Homework": refers to the assigned chapters in the "Coursekata" (CK) textbook each week. You can access it from the `Course Website` -> `Modules`. It will be graded based on completeness. Ensure your progress is recorded in the "My Progress" module, which can be accessed from `Open My Progress + Jupyter` -> `Class`. 
+ "Participation" (Total: 150 points). There are two ways to earn participation points:
  - During each lecture, the professor will walk you through a "Jupyter Notebook assignment". You can access it from the `Course Website` -> Click the `Open My Progress + Jupyter` link on the top -> Select the `Jupyter` tab. Submitting it by the end of class earns you 10 participation points. We will grade it based on completeness and accuracy. If you do not submit it by the end of the lecture, you can attend the TA discussion section that week, and your deadline to submit that week's "Jupyter Notebook assignment(s)" extends to that Friday by midnight. 
  - Attending each "discussion section" adds 10 points towards your "Participation" grade, and you can earn up to 50 points from attending TA sections.
+ "Quizzes": We will have two in-class and two take-home quizzes. 
+ "Final Exam": The final exam is 3 hours long and is held in person. The first part of the final exam is on paper and you cannot use any electronic devices. The second part of the final exam is on your computer. Both parts are open-note.

**Your Weekly Things to Do**: Please check the course website on BruinLearn for class policies, updates, deadlines, etc.
+ Before each lecture (on Tuesday or Thursday), complete the assigned reading and questions in the Coursekata (CK) textbook.   
+ Tuesday: go to the lecture and complete the Jupyter Notebook assignment during class. Submit it at the end of class. Note that for 10/29 and 11/12, we have in-class quizzes instead.
+ Thursday: go to the lecture and complete the Jupyter Notebook assignment during class. Submit it at the end of class.
+ Friday: attend the TA section if needed.
