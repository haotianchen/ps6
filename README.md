## TA Section Syllabus
**Meeting Time and Location**: We will meet every Friday online. Please use this Zoom link. You have to attend the full 50-minute section to receive full credits.

**Format**: During each section, we will quickly review the lecture materials in the first 10-15 minutes. We will then discuss any questions you may have about the Jupyter Notebook assignments, CK Chapters, or upcoming quizzes for the rest of the time. 

**Communication**: My email address is: barneychen@ucla.edu. I will reply to your email within 24 to 48 hours (except weekends or holidays). Please adhere to professional email etiquette. 

**Office Hours**: My office hours are by appointment, using this link: https://calendly.com/barneychen-q_g/ps6. 

**Grade Policy**: For full grading policy, please refer to the course website. Your grade is calculated based on four parts: 
+ "Homework": it refers to the assigned chapters in the "Coursekata" (CK) textbook each week. We will grade it based on completeness. Make sure your progress is captured in the "My Progress" module. 
+ "Participation" (Total: 150 points). There are two ways to earn participation points:
  - During each of the lecture, the professor will walk you through a "Jupyter Notebook assignment". Submiting it by the end of class earns you 10 participation points. We will grade it based on completeness and accuracy. If you fail to submit it by the end of lecture, you can attend the TA discussion section that week and your deadline to submit that week's "Jupyter Notebook assignment(s)" extends to that Friday by midnight. 
  - Attending each "discussion section" adds 10 points towards your "Participation" grade, and you can earn up to 50 points from attending TA sections.
+ "Quizzes": We will have two in-class and two take-home quizzes. 
+ "Final Exam": The final exam is 3 hours long and hold in-person. The first part of the final exam is on paper and you cannot use any electronic devices. The second part of the final exam is on your computer. Both parts are open-note.

**Your Weekly Things to Do**: Please check the course website on BruinLearn for class policies, updates, deadlines, etc.
+ Before each lecture (on Tuesday or Thursday), complete the assigned reading and questions in the Coursekata (CK) textbook. Most of the weeks you will be assigned two chapters, whereas for some weeks it is one chapter.  
+ Tuesday: go to the lecture and complete the Jupyter Notebook assignment during class (except for 10/22 and 11/05, we have in-class quizzes instead). Submit it at the end of class.
+ Thursday: go to the lecture and complete the Jupyter Notebook assignment during class. Submit it at the end of class.
+ Friday: attend the TA section if needed.
+ For Week 2 and Week 8, we have the take-home quiz due on the weekend.
